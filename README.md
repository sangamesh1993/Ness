Number line, 2 hours
 

 
Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and/or jQuery, create a number line with two draggable points. Similar to the image shown above, the number line should have:
路 A horizontal line with 11 tick marks labeled from -5 to 5.
路 Have two points that are draggable along the horizontal line. The user should not be able to drag the points off of or outside of the horizontal line.
路 The user cannot drag and place the points in between two tick marks. Instead, points will snap to the closest tick mark.
